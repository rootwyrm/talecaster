# Linux
Docker-based 'basic' configurations are validated and working, but not documented. This is not recommended for use at this time. Extensive work has been done to polish them up for individual module use but integration work is not complete. Advanced knowledge of disk and filesystem management is required to make use of these.

This is recommended for virtual environments and folks just looking to get an idea of how things work.

# FreeBSD
Most work on FreeBSD has been discontinued, due to overt hostility and threats of physical harm which have been made by members of the FreeBSD core team. Consequently, we have no interest in providing the software to people who do not want it and have stated they will physically assault or muder people who do work on it.
