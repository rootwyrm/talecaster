# Linux
Docker-based 'basic' configurations are validated and working, and documentation is in progress!
TaleCaster is designed to be deployed using `docker-compose` as a full application suite and comes with a web front end.

# HALP PLEASE!
* Documentation! Documenting how to set up TaleCaster, Synology, etc.
* The build status table is a nightmare. There has to be a better way?

# FreeBSD
Most work on FreeBSD has been discontinued, due to overt hostility and threats of physical harm which have been made by members of the FreeBSD core team. Consequently, we have no interest in providing the software to people who do not want it and have stated they will harass or physically assault people who do work on it.
