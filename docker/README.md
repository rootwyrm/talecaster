# TaleCaster for Docker

Note: this is for **advanced** users. If you pull/build tc_docker directly, you WILL BREAK THINGS. You have been warned.

*READ ME, THIS IS IMPORTANT:*
SickRage has been removed due to being changed by the maintainer into a means to farm personally identifying information and computer information.

# HEADS UP!
Due to various updates, discontinuations, maintainers going the route of fraud, and so on, I am restructuring things to reduce the number of variables. You can still use your own stuff if you want of course. But TaleCaster is really designed to be a one-stop-shop so it's recommended you just roll with the punches.

Going Forward, TaleCaster will be comprised of:
* nzbget
* Deluge
* Sonarr
* Radarr
* headphones
* lazylibrarian
* Lidarr/Beets (ALPHA)

Note that we do NOT plan to discontinue headphones support due to significant missing features in Lidarr, especially relating to conversion. Lidarr should be considered extremely alpha quality and assumed to NOT function.
